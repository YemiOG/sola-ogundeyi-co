            Managing company’s tax strategy and statutory obligations in the
            face of today’s complex puzzle of rules and regulations can drain
            company’s time, money and resources. With dwindling sources of
            revenue for government across the globe, there is more focus on tax
            revenue and enforcement of tax laws. Tax compliance has now become
            more important and tax is as sure as death. Tax is a preferential
            debt even in a case of bankruptcy and this takes precedence before
            any payment of secured and unsecured creditors. Tax strategies that
            harness the potential of change and align with the needs of business
            are crucial to sustainable growth. We partner with our clients in
            the areas of planning, accounting, controls, compliance, reporting
            and negotiating with tax authorities in order to mitigate
            reputational risks and enhance productivity. Our tax professionals
            help our clients to ensure compliance with domestic and
            international tax laws. We also keep clients current on the latest
            changes that will impact the business’ tax strategy. We take a
            holistic view of tax, combining industries insight with the
            technical skills of our financial and tax professionals, both
            in-house and consultant experts, to develop comprehensive integrated
            solutions.

                We assist our clients in building a strategic tax plan that fits
                into the overall corporate plan and enterprise risk framework by
                aligning organisation’s goals and planned business volumes with
                the tax implications and ensuring strategic, tactical and
                transactional business solutions that minimise tax impacts.

                in a timely manner, avoiding unnecessary penalties and
                optimising tax savings. Late filing is now a major issue from
                the Revenue point of view and a compounded interest is charged
                on unpaid tax liabilities and penalties. We assist you to avoid
                this problem by prompting for early filing.

                We assist our clients in obtaining acceptance certificates on
                fixed assets additions from the Ministry of Industries. This is
                a requirement for the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) to
                grant capital allowance on assets with values above N500,000.
                Companies cannot afford to have their capital allowances
                disallowed because of the tax implications. We will process this

                We assist our clients in managing transaction taxes especially

                optimise the applicable taxes. We follow up to obtain the
                related tax credits and refunds. It is important to note that
                withholding tax is an advance tax and companies need to obtain
                WHT receipts to offset their income tax liability. We also
                assist in managing the company’s tax position records with the
                Revenue.
