            Our audit and assurance practice provides both financial statement
            verification and integrated audit services. Our goal is to provide
            assurance service that can be viewed as independent and reliable,
            and in the process improve financial reporting processes and
            standards of our clients. Our audit approach is designed to comply
            with both the Nigerian and International accounting and auditing
            standards. Our tried and tested approach, together with our
            multidisciplinary teams and effective procedures provide the means
            for our clients to receive audit &amp; assurance services that meet
            the highest standards. We guarantee that our service is independent,
            unbiased, professional, objective and technically excellent. We take
            pride in tailoring our approach to meet our clientsâ€™ particular
            needs. We make it our business to keep clients informed of
            accounting developments that may have an impact on their businesses.
            Around the world, the journey to success is governed by increasingly
            complex and broadening regulatory requirements and stakeholder
            demands. Strong independent assurance helps meet these demands by
            providing a timely and constructive challenge to management, a
            robust and clear perspective to audit committees and critical
            information for investors and other stakeholders.
