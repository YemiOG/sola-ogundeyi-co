The need to ensure the application of efficient Financial reporting, Payroll, Corporate and Value Added Tax planning strategies stem from the fact that the Nigerian tax and VAT laws/fiscal policies now being constantly reviewed give room for enormous tax saving opportunities and if properly applied, engender confidence in an organisation's tax position.

As experts in the field of tax planning and management and audit & financial reporting, we constantly adopt a proactive approach to our work. This requires that we acquire a thorough understanding of your establishment and the tax environment to which it belongs.

## Our Services

Our audit and assurance practice provides both financial statement verification and integrated audit services. Our goal is to provide assurance service that can be viewed as independent and reliable, and in the process improve financial reporting processes and standards of our clients.

Our audit approach is designed to comply with both the Nigerian and International accounting and auditing standards. Our tried and tested approach, together with our multidisciplinary teams and effective procedures provide the means for our clients to receive audit & assurance services that meet the highest standards.

We guarantee that our service is independent, unbiased, professional, objective and technically excellent. We take pride in tailoring our approach to meet our clients’ particular needs. We make it our business to keep clients informed of accounting developments that may have an impact on their businesses.

Around the world, the journey to success is governed by increasingly complex and broadening regulatory requirements and stakeholder demands. Strong independent assurance helps meet these demands by providing a timely and constructive challenge to management, a robust and clear perspective to audit committees and critical information for investors and other stakeholders.

Our audit and assurance services include:

Ø Financial Assurance Services

Conducting financial audits and other information assurance services so as to ensure that financial and other information provided by the establishments are reliable and conforms to statutory requirements.

Ø Contract Audit Services

Providing internal audit services to help companies assess business risk and controls and improve business process performance.

Ø Contract Accounting Services

Ø Investigation & Forensic Services

We also help organisations to review their bank statements, financial transactions over a period and recover excess bank charges. We are also structured to assist various tiers of government to review the performance and extent of compliance of their revenue collection agents with agreed service standards.

- Tax planning and Management

Managing company’s tax strategy and statutory obligations in the face of today’s complex puzzle of rules and regulations can drain company’s time, money and resources. With dwindling sources of revenue for government across the globe, there is more focus on tax revenue and enforcement of tax laws. Tax compliance has now become more important and tax is as sure as death. Tax is a preferential debt even in a case of bankruptcy and this takes precedence before any payment of secured and unsecured creditors.

Tax strategies that harness the potential of change and align with the needs of business are crucial to sustainable growth. We partner with our clients in the areas of planning, accounting, controls, compliance, reporting and negotiating with tax authorities in order to mitigate reputational risks and enhance productivity.

Our tax professionals help our clients to ensure compliance with domestic and international tax laws. We also keep clients current on the latest changes that will impact the business’ tax strategy. We take a holistic view of tax, combining industries insight with the technical skills of our financial and tax professionals, both in-house and consultant experts, to develop comprehensive integrated solutions.

Our tax planning and management services include:

Ø Strategic Tax Planning

We assist our clients in building a strategic tax plan that fits into the overall corporate plan and enterprise risk framework by aligning organisation’s goals and planned business volumes with the tax implications and ensuring strategic, tactical and transactional business solutions that minimise tax impacts.

Ø Corporate Tax Filing

We assist our clients in preparing and filing their tax returns in a timely manner, avoiding unnecessary penalties and optimising tax savings. Late filing is now a major issue from the Revenue point of view and a compounded interest is charged on unpaid tax liabilities and penalties. We assist you to avoid this problem by prompting for early filing

Ø Handling of Statutory Payments

We assist our clients in the process of obtaining, registering, analysing, computing on a monthly basis and filing of tax returns. We assist in handling payments and maintaining records of the relevant files for Income Tax, Educational Tax, Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE), Value Added Tax (VAT), Withholding Tax (WHT) management and IT Tax.

Ø Acceptance Certificate on Fixed Assets Additions

We assist our clients in obtaining acceptance certificates on fixed assets additions from the Ministry of Industries. This is a requirement for the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) to grant capital allowance on assets with values above N500,000. Companies cannot afford to have their capital allowances disallowed because of the tax implications. We will process this certificate for you within a very short period.

Ø Withholding Tax (WHT) Management

We assist our clients in managing transaction taxes especially withholding taxes. We help in structuring transactions to optimise the applicable taxes. We follow up to obtain the related tax credits and refunds. It is important to note that withholding tax is an advance tax and companies need to obtain WHT receipts to offset their income tax liability. We also assist in managing the company’s tax position records with the Revenue.

Ø Value Added Tax (VAT) Services

We assist our clients in filing their VAT returns and provide advice on implication of VAT on proposed transactions. We assist in claiming the relevant input VAT and VAT refunds where applicable. We also offer VAT accounting solutions.

Ø Comprehensive Tax Health Check

We assist our clients to undertake self reviews of their tax compliance, either pre-statutory audit or pre-revenue authority audit. We ensure that there are no surprises before major events such as back duty audits, acquisition or merger.

Ø Payroll and Employee Tax Management

We assist management in handling their payroll function for both local and expatriate employees, designing flexible and tax efficient payroll system and devising expatriates tax solutions.

Ø Tax Report Services

We prove tax compliance reporting, tax process improvement solutions and quantitative data analysis. We also provide update on tax implications of policy changes.

Meeting statutory and regulatory obligations and satisfying increasing stakeholders’ interest demands for strong corporate governance but this continues to provide challenges for many organisations. Compliance mistakes and omissions can expose firms to penalties. The potential business and reputational risks can be significant.

Our financial advisory group can assist you to meet these challenges with the following services:

Ø Statutory Compliance Services

We assist in maintaining statutory books, handling of filing of annual returns, recording of minutes and attending to Corporate Affairs Commissions’ filing requirements.

Ø Advisory Services

We assist in company formations, registration of liaison and branch offices. We also liaise with Corporate Affairs Commission and other regulatory authorities to obtain approval for foreign

and/or local investment, concessions, and incentives. We help in identifying suitable locations and also in registering Trade mark.

Ø Reporting Accounting Services

We act as reporting accountants to capital raising issues. This involves reviewing of the past financial statements for the purpose of reporting on the accounting policies and the accounts as well as reviewing prepared financial forecasts, budgets, cash flow statements and other financial reports that may be required by capital market regulatory authorizes for the purpose of offering filing.
